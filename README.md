EEE 120: Extra Credit Design Problem
Design a synchronous counter that counts up 0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 2, 3, ... when an input x = 1, and
down when x = 0 using
(a) D flip-flops.
(b) J-K flip-flops.
You need to show the state definition table, the state transition diagram, the state transition table,
the K-maps for the respective logic functions and the schematic of the implementation using flip-
flops and logic gates in (a) as well as the K-maps for the logic functions and the schematic in (b).

Note:
1) You can either create an electronic document and submit your answer in a word or
pdf format.
2) Or you can work on a scratch paper and scan your answer with a scanner. If you don't
have a scanner you may use a camera such as on a computer or a phone to take a
picture. Transfer your picture to your computer and upload your picture in .pdf
or .jpg format.
3) You are welcome to simulate your design using Logisim to verify its functionality but
it is NOT required.
